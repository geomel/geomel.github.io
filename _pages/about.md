Hi, and welcome to my website. I am currently a PhD candidate at the <a href="www.uom.gr">University of Macedonia</a> working at the <a href="https://se.uom.gr">Software Engineering Lab group</a>. My research interests are on the area of Software Engineering and more specific in software design, quality, evolution analysis and maintenability. 

I hold a BSc on Applied Informatics (2008), a MSc on Computer Systems (2010) and i am working as a software engineer ever since. I also have experience in working as a researcher in EU-funded projects as part of my work in the software engineering lab group.

In my other half working-life i am a managing partner at Idrogios Education, the leading Educational Robotics and Informatics lifelong educational and certification center in Greece, where i am a founding member and head since 2009.

I have nearly 20 years experience working with various programming languages, technologies and frameworks. I am currently working on Web3 full stack technologies and enjoying building Dapps with Smart Contracts and Web frameworks. I actively develop in Java, Javascript (Node, React), MERN stack, Solidity, PHP, Python and i am proficient in using various DevOps tools.
